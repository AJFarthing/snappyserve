## Welcome to the snappyserve repository! 

This project utilizes a neural network to make predictions on food items. 
Whether you're interested in understanding the implementation details, running the web application, or contributing to the project, you'll find everything you need to get started here.

### - Introduction
This project aims to predict food items using a trained neural network model. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can make accurate predictions based on various features and characteristics of different food items.
We can then make use of a simple web app to make inferences with our trained model as a proof of concept.

### - Files in the Repository
model_file: This directory contains the trained neural network model file.
notebook: Explore the Jupyter notebook for in-depth analysis, training, and evaluation of the neural network.
web_app_script: Contains the script for the web application built to demonstrate food predictions.
README.md: You are here! This file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for usage.
(please note that the original model is not the same as the model making inferences in the web app)
